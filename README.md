 Modelling batter hits in the MLB

Data is taken from the MLB and <a href='https://www.fangraphs.com/'>fangraphs</a>. Some functionality is borrowed from <a href='https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball'>pybaseball</a>.

Code is provided primarily in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks that can be run using Google Colab. This is a work in progress project intended for education and fun. I provide no guarantee that this code will be maintained or function in perpetuity, especially due to its reliance on third-party APIs including the MLB's. Please visit <a href='https://joseph-bae.github.io/'>my website</a> for updates on the progress of this work. Good luck on beating the streak!
